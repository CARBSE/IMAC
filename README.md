The aim of this tool is to calculate indoor comfort temperatures or ‘Average Neutral Operative Temperatures’ for 160 Indian cities and towns and provide temperature ranges where 90% or 80% of occupants would feel comfortable in a building. This tool calculates these temperatures for commercial as well as residential buildings using a region’s Typical meteorological year (TMY) data.
